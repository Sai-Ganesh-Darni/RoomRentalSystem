## Room Rental System Project Using MERN

### Overview

This is a room rental system project built using the following technologies:

* MongoDB: A NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing and querying data about rooms, users, and bookings.
* Express.js: A Node.js web framework that provides a simple and efficient way to build web applications.
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Next.js: A React framework that provides a number of features for building server-rendered web applications, such as static site generation and incremental static regeneration.

### Features

The room rental system project using MERN typically includes the following features:

* User authentication and authorization: Users must create an account and log in before they can rent or list rooms. Users are authorized to perform different actions based on their role, such as renting rooms, listing rooms, and managing bookings.
* Room listing and search: Users can list their rooms for rent and search for rooms to rent. The search functionality allows users to filter results by location, price, amenities, and other criteria.
